This portfolio contains files of multiple types with varying significance that showcase my skills with, primarily but not limited to, EXCEL/GOOGLE SHEETS, SQL, R, TABLEAU, AND PYTHON.  

The files are organized into the following types:

SIMPLE TASKS - these are simple and quick files that show basic tasks such as FETCH, SORT, FILTER, PIVOT TABLES, QUERIES of varying complexity, etc.

PROJECTS - These are more INDEPTH ANALYSES that may or may not include the associated code but will rather be formatted in a way that focuses on a wider audience, such as STAKEHOLDERS.  These will likely include full writen reports and visualizations.

Projects will be clearly labeled.
